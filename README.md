# Sorting-Algorithms-for-NEWBS
This series is made to make the learning and revising sorting algorithms as easily as possible for anyone and specially people who want to
improve their understanding of how those algorithms work, my motive for doing this was that i struglled a lot in college to understand these concepts and why they are important, so i decided i should be a part of the solution, my aim was to learn and understand them very well, and try to explain them as good as i can. Code was filled in with a lot of comments, to make every line as easy to learn as possible, which was extremelly hard for me to influence the reader to grasp the right intuition of the algorithm correctly through comments only. I hope i have done anything that could make your life easier. If you didn't find it good enough or want me to explain other algorithms just email me with your question and i'll try explaining it better, thanks a lot for checking this out.
